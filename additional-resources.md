## 2023 Hurricane Outlook Now Available

WeatherTiger has released its [April, 2023 outlook](https://weathertiger.substack.com/p/atlantic-hurricane-season-first-look-b6e) for the upcoming hurricane season. This year, changes in the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) from La Niña to neutral or El Niño could result in a lower hurricane potential than the previous three years.

## Tropical Storm and Hurricane Predictions

In addition to the outlook above, this [resource from Colorado State University](https://tropical.colostate.edu/resources.html) is a great place to learn about hurricane predictions for a specific area of interest.
