## Welcome

This website has been created to help visualize the potential impacts sea level changes will have on the coastal areas of northwest Florida and as a resource to learn more about the projections for specific communities. The data on this website can be used to put more global changes into perspective, and see what the future might look like under various climate scenarios. Sea level rise and flood risk are both important factors that will define how significant changes are.

**Predictions for the 2021 hurricane season in the panhandle are available [here](/additional-resources).**
