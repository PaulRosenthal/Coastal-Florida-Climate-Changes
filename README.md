# Sea Florida Change - Northwest Florida Coastal Changes

Welcome to the Sea Florida Change repository; it has been created to help visualize anticipated sea level variance over time.

## Production and Testing Environments

There are two environments associated with this project. The first is the production website that is accessible via [https://SeaFLChange.org](https://SeaFLChange.org). The second is an environment used for development and testing. It is accessible via [test.SeaFLChange.org](https://test.SeaFLChange.org).

The badges below show the status of the most recent continuous integration pipeline runs (used to ensure source code changes do not induce website deployment failures and pass a series of RSpec tests) and test environment build:

## Feedback or Contributions

I hope you find this site useful, and I would be happy to incorporate any feedback you might have.
